These are plugins that I've marked as obsolete, as the starbound
clients/servers already implement much of the same features, making these
redundant.

I might come back and fix the warp plugin at some point, since there are
still some warps that we can do that starbound doesn't allow... but this is
less of a priority for me at the moment.

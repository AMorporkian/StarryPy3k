These are plugins that I've marked as obsolete, as the starbound
clients/servers already implement much of the same features, making these
redundant.

I might come back and fix the warp plugin at some point, since there are
still some warps that we can do that starbound doesn't allow... but this is
less of a priority for me at the moment.

I'm adding watchdog and web_plugin in here as well, since they both need
code attention, but are not a high priority for me at the moment. Also, as a
 way of alerting users down the line that they aren't ready for use yet.
